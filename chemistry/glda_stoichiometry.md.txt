# Chemical Protocol: GLDA Chelation & Struvite Recovery

## 1. The Chemical Objective
The core challenge of the RAPL process is **Selectivity**. We must liberate Phosphorus (P) from organic sludge without allowing Strontium-90 (Sr-90) to co-precipitate into the final fertilizer product.

**The Solution:** Use **L-Glutamic acid N,N-diacetic acid (GLDA)** as a "Molecular Bodyguard." GLDA selectively binds divalent cations (Sr²⁺, Ca²⁺, heavy metals), keeping them soluble in the waste stream, while allowing Phosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) to remain free for harvesting.

## 2. Stoichiometry & Molar Ratios

### The Chelation Mechanism
GLDA acts as a tetradentate chelator, wrapping around metal ions in a 1:1 molar ratio.

**Primary Reaction (Strontium Sequestration):**
$$\text{Sr}^{2+} + \text{GLDA}^{4-} \rightarrow [\text{Sr(GLDA)}]^{2-}$$

* **Stability Constant (Log K):** ~8.5 (Estimated for Sr²⁺).
* **Function:** This complex is highly stable in aqueous solution, preventing the Strontium from reacting with the liberated Phosphate to form Strontium Phosphate (Sr₃(PO₄)₂), which is insoluble.

### Mass Balance (Per 1000 kg Batch)
Based on average sewage sludge composition and Sr-90 trace contamination limits.

| Component | Concentration | Molecular Weight | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sewage Sludge (Dry)** | 1000 kg | N/A | Feedstock |
| **Target P** | ~1.0 kg | 30.97 g/mol | Yield Target |
| **GLDA (Tetrasodium)** | **3.0 kg** | 351.1 g/mol | Chelating Agent |
| **Magnesium (Mg²⁺)** | Added to 1:1:1 ratio | 24.30 g/mol | Struvite Precursor |

> **Engineering Note:** We use a **0.3% w/w** GLDA concentration (3kg per ton). This provides a massive molar excess relative to the trace Strontium, ensuring virtually 100% capture probability ("The Law of Mass Action").

## 3. The pH Phase Cycle (The "Chef's Steps")

The reaction is driven by precise pH manipulation.

### Phase 1: Acidic Lysis (pH 4.0 – 5.0)
* **Action:** Reactor slurry is acidified (organic acids + decay heat).
* **Effect:**
    * Solid mineral phosphates dissolve: $\text{Ca}_{10}(\text{PO}_4)_6(\text{OH})_2 + \text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{PO}_4^{3-}$
    * **Critical Safety Step:** GLDA immediately binds any released Sr²⁺ ions. Because the environment is acidic, the Strontium *wants* to be free, but the GLDA cage holds it.

### Phase 2: The "Struvite Crash" (pH 8.5)
* **Action:** After 7 days of irradiation, Magnesium (Mg²⁺) and Ammonium (NH₄⁺) are verified, and pH is raised using NaOH or lime.
* **Effect:** The "Solubility Product" ($K_{sp}$) of Struvite is exceeded.
* **Reaction:**
    $$\text{Mg}^{2+} + \text{NH}_4^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-} + 6\text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{MgNH}_4\text{PO}_4 \cdot 6\text{H}_2\text{O} \downarrow$$
* **The Safety Mechanism:** At pH 8.5, Strontium normally precipitates. However, the **[Sr-GLDA]²⁻** complex remains soluble.
    * **Result:** White Struvite crystals form (solid). Strontium stays in the liquid (supernatant).

## 4. Radiolytic Stability
* **Challenge:** High beta radiation can degrade organic molecules like GLDA.
* **Resilience:** GLDA is structurally more resistant to radiolysis than EDTA.
* **Breakdown Products:** If GLDA degrades, it breaks into Glycine and Glutamate (harmless amino acids).
* **Safety Factor:** The reactor residence time (7-14 days) is well within the half-life of GLDA under 1 kCi exposure. The chelation holds long enough to filter the crystals.

## 5. Final Separation
1.  **Filtration:** Slurry is passed through a 10-micron mesh.
2.  **Solids (Fertilizer):** Captured Struvite crystals. Checked for radiation.
3.  **Liquids (Waste):** Contains the dissolved [Sr-GLDA] complex.
4.  **Disposal:** The liquid waste is passed through a **Zeolite/Biochar** column to strip the Strontium for recycling or vitrification.
